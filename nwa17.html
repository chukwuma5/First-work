                South Africa is a developing country. It has been classified by the World Bank as a newly industrialised
                country, with the second-largest economy in Africa, and the 33rd-largest in the
                world.<sup>20][21]</sup><br>
                South Africa also has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa. The country is a middle power in
                international affairs; it maintains significant regional influence and is a member of both the<br>
                Commonwealth of Nations and G20.[22][23] <br>
                poverty and inequality remain widespread, with about a quarter of the population unemployed and

                unemployed and living on less than US$1.25 a day.[24][25] Moreover, climate change is an important

                for <a href="aside">Southafrica</a>:it is a major contributor to climate change as the 14th largest
                emitter of greenhouse gases as of 2018<br>
                (in large part due to its coal industry),[26] and is vulnerable to many of its impacts, because of its
                water-insecure environment and vulnerable communities.<br>

                The name "South Africa" is derived from the country's geographic location at the southern tip of Africa.
                Upon formation, the country was named the Union of South Africa<br>
                in English and Unie van Zuid-Afrika in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language"
                    target="_blank">Dutch,</a> reflecting its origin from the unification of four formerly separate
                British colonies. Since 1961, the long formal name in English has been the "Republic of South Africa"
                and Republiek van Suid-Afrika in Afrikaans. <br>
                Since 1994, the country has had an official name in each of its 11 official languages.<br>
                Mzansi, derived from the Xhosa noun uMzantsi meaning "south", is a <a

                South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and <a href="aside">human-fossil</a> sites in
                the world.[30][31][32] Archaeologists have recovered extensive fossil remains from a series of caves in
                Gauteng Province. The area, a UNESCO World Heritage site, has been branded "the <a href="aside">Cradle
                    of Humankind".</a><br>
                The sites include <a href="aside">Sterkfontein, </a>one of the richest sites for hominin fossils in the
                world. Other sites include Swartkrans, Gondolin Cave, Kromdraai, <a href="aside">Coopers Cave and
                    Malapa.</a>Raymond Dart identified the first hominin fossil discovered in Africa, the Taung Child
                (found near Taung) in 1924. <br>
                Further hominin remains have come from the sites of Makapansgat in Limpopo Province, Cornelia and
                Florisbad in the Free State Province, Border Cave in <a href="">KwaZulu-Natal Province</a>, Klasies
                River Mouth in <a href="aside">Eastern Cape</a> Province <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                These finds suggest that various hominid species existed in South Africa from about three million years
                ago, starting with Australopithecus africanus.[33] <br>
                There followed species including Australopithecus sediba, Homo ergaster, Homo erectus, Homo
                rhodesiensis, Homo helmei, Homo naledi and modern humans (Homo sapiens).<br>
                Homo helmei, Homo naledi and modern humans (Homo sapiens). Modern humans have inhabited Southern Africa
                for at least 170,000 years.

                The earliest ironworks in modern-day KwaZulu-Natal Province are believed to date from around 1050. The
                southernmost group was the Xhosa people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the
                earlier Khoisan people. The Xhosa reached the Great Fish River,<br>
                in today's Eastern Cape Province. As they migrated, these larger Iron Age populations displaced or
                assimilated earlier peoples. In Mpumalanga Province,<br>

                At the time of European contact, the dominant ethnic group was Bantu-speaking peoples who migrated from
                other parts of Africa about one thousand years before. The two major historic groups were the Xhosa and
                Zulu peoples.<br>
                Esperança, or Cape of Good Hope, as it led to the riches of the East Indies.[39] Dias' feat of
                navigation was later immortalised in Luís de Camões' Portuguese epic poem, The Lusiads (1572).<br>
                He reached as far up the eastern coast of Africa as, what he called, Rio do Infante, probably the
                present-day Groot River, in May 1488, but on his return he saw the Cape, which he first named Cabo das
                Tormentas ('Cape of Storms').<br>

                South Africa is located at the southernmost region of Africa, with a long coastline that stretches more
                than 2,500 km (1,553 mi) and along two oceans (the South Atlantic and the Indian). At 1,219,912 km2
                (471,011 sq mi),[85] South Africa is the 24th-largest country in the world.[86]<br>
                Mafadi in the Drakensberg at 3,450 m (11,320 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa. Excluding the
                Prince Edward Islands, the country lies between latitudes 22° and 35°S, and longitudes 16° and 33°E.<br>
                24th-largest country in the world.[86] It is about the same size as <a href="aside">Colombia,</a> twice

                right) is known as the <a href="aside">Great Karoo, </a>which consists of sparsely populated scrubland.
                To the north, the Great Karoo fades into the even drier and more arid Bushmanland, which eventually
                becomes the Kalahari desert in the very north-west of the country.<br>

                The coastal belt below the south and south-western stretches of the Great Escarpment contains several
                ranges of Cape Fold Mountains which run parallel to the coast, separating the Great Escarpment from the
                ocean.[94][95] (These parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on<br>

                South Africa signed the <a href="aside">Rio</a> Convention on Biological Diversity on 4 June 1994, and
                became a party to the convention on 2 November 1995.[106] It has subsequently produced a National
                Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, <br>
                June 2006.[107] The country is ranked sixth out of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries.[108]
                Ecotourism in South Africa has become more prevalent in recent years, as a possible method of
                maintaining and improving biodiversity.<br>

                Numerous <a href="aside">mammals </a>are found in the Bushveld including lions, African leopards, South
                African cheetahs, southern white rhinos, blue wildebeest, kudus, impalas, hyenas, hippopotamuses and
                South African giraffes.<br>
                A significant extent of the Bushveld exists in the north-east including Kruger National Park and the

            <h4>Fungi</h4>
            <p>
                Up to 1945, more than 4900 species of fungi (including lichen-forming species) had been recorded.[109]
                In
                2006, the number of fungi in South Africa was estimated at about 200,000 species,<br> but did not take
                into
                account fungi associated with insects.[110]<br>
                African ecosystems, an exceptionally high percentage of fungi are highly specific in terms of the plants
                with which they occur.[111] The country's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan does not mention fungi
                (including lichen-forming fungi).[107]<br>
            </p>

            <h4>
                plants
            </h4>

            <div class="topine">
                With more than 22,000 different higher plants, or about 9% of all the known species of plants on
                Earth,[112] South Africa is particularly rich in plant diversity. The most prevalent biome in South
                Africa is the grassland, <br>
                Highveld, where the plant cover is dominated by different grasses, low shrubs, and acacia trees, mainly
                camel-thorn (Vachellia erioloba). Vegetation becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low
                rainfall. <br>

                        Each of the nine provinces is governed by a unicameral legislature, which is elected every five
                        years by party-list proportional representation. The legislature elects a Premier as head of
                        government, and the Premier appoints an Executive Council as a provincial cabinet. The powers of
                        provincial governments are limited to topics listed in the Constitution;<br>

                (US$11,750 at purchasing power parity as of 2012). Despite this, South Africa is still burdened by a

                Despite this, South Africa is still burdened by a relatively high rate of poverty and unemployment, and
                is also ranked in the top ten countries in the world for income inequality,[158][159][160] measured by
                the Gini coefficient. In 2015, 71 percent of net wealth are held by 10 percent richest of the
                population, whereas 60 percent of the poorest held only 7 percent of the net wealth and the Gini
                coefficient was 0.63, whereas in 1996 was 0.61.[161]<br>
